# Exit_time
MATLAB codes to support Simpson et al. (2021)  Exit time for diffusion on irregular domains.

The code that evaluates perturbation solutions is all contained within MATLAB, however code for the finite volume numerical solutions and the random walk solutions requires GMSH to create the finite volume mesh.  Code available at https://gmsh.info/
