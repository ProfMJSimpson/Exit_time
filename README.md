# Exit_time
MATLAB codes to support Simpson et al. (2021)  Exit time for diffusion on irregular domains

These MATLAB codes require GMSH to generate unstructured meshes for the finite volume and random walk calculations.  The software can be downloaded at https://gmsh.info/

The MATLAB codes also include ellipse fitting tools from Szpak et al. (2015) https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10851-014-0536-x
