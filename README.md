# Exit_time
MATLAB codes to support Simpson et al. (2021)  Mean exit time for diffusion on irregular domains

These codes requires Gmsh: A three-dimensional finite element mesh generator with built-in pre- and post-processing facilities.  This free software is required to 
generate unstructured finite volume meshes for both the numerical solution of the boundary value problem, as well as the interpolation of the random walk results.  
The software is available at https://gmsh.info/

These code also require software associated with Guaranteed ellipse fitting with a confidence region and an uncertainty measure for centre, axes, and orientation.
